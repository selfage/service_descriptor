# @selfage/service_descriptor

## Install

`npm install @selfage/service_descriptor`

## Overview

Written in TypeScript and compiled to ES6 with inline source map & source. See [@selfage/tsconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@selfage/tsconfig) for full compiler options. Provides a TypeScript interface `ServiceDescriptor` to be referenced when implementing `@selfage/service_handler` or when calling services via `@selfage/web_service_client`. A `ServiceDescriptor` is usually generated by `@selfage/cli`.

## Generate ServiceDescriptor

With `@selfage/cli`, it requires an input file, e.g., `service.json` which looks like the following.

```JSON
[{
  "message": {
    "name": "GetCommentsRequest"
    ...
  }
}, {
  "message": {
    "name": "GetCommentsResponse"
    ...
  }
}, {
  "service": {
    "name": "GetComments",
    "path": "/get_comments",
    "request": "GetCommentsRequest",
    "response": "GetCommentsResponse"
  }
}, {
  "service": {
    "name": "GetHistory",
    "path": "/get_history",
    "request": "GetHistoryRequest",
    "importRequest": "./request_def",
    "response": "GetHistoryResponse",
    "importResponse": "./response_def"
  }
}]
```

By running `selfage gen service`, it will generate `service.ts` file, which looks like the following.

```TypeScript
import { MessageDescriptor, PrimitiveType } from '@selfage/message/descriptor';
import { UnauthedServiceDescriptor, AuthedServiceDescriptor } from '@selfage/service_descriptor';
import { GetHistoryRequest, GET_HISTORY_REQUEST } from './request_def';
import { GetHistoryResponse, GET_HISTORY_RESPONSE } from './response_def';

// ... Generated messages for GetCommentsRequest and GetCommentsResponse.

export let GET_COMMENTS: UnauthedServiceDescriptor<GetCommentsRequest, GetCommentsResponse> = {
  name: "GetComments",
  path: "/get_comments",
  requestDescriptor: GET_COMMENTS_REQUEST,
  responseDescriptor: GET_COMMENTS_RESPONSE,
};

export let GET_HISTORY: AuthedServiceDescriptor<GetHistoryRequest, GetHistoryResponse> = {
  name: "GetHistory",
  path: "/get_history",
  requestDescriptor: GET_HISTORY_REQUEST,
  responseDescriptor: GET_HISTORY_RESPONSE,
};
```

It's recommended to commit `service.ts` as part of your source code.

The schema of the json file is an array of [definition](https://github.com/selfage/cli/blob/0f724015a4ea309d80ff231db555fe0383c91329/generate/definition.ts#L73). See `@selfage/message` for explanation of generating messages. `request` and `response` each refers to a message, and each can be imported following Nodejs's module path resolution.

When `request` contains a field named as `signedSession`, that `service` is then treated as an authed service. If not, an unauthed service. E.g., `request_def.json` might look like the following.

```JSON
[{
  "message": {
    "name": "GetHistoryRequest",
    "fields": [{
      "name": "signedSession",
      "type": "string"
    }, {
      "name": "userId",
      "type": "string"
    }]
  }
}]
```

You usually don't need to explicitly set `signedSession` field or read it. See `@selfage/web_service_client` for how it is set. See `@selfage/service_handler` for it was generated, read and parsed, where a definition of session needs to be provided.

## Design considerations

`path` is not generated by `name` because you would need them when debugging. Therefore explicitly specifying it can save anyone from understanding the rule to generate it.

`signedSession` field for authed request is probably an unusual decision when most frameworks use HTTP headers to implicitly pass them. The downside seems to be that it needs to be repeated for each authed request, but in fact, one has to specify a service is authed in one way or another.
